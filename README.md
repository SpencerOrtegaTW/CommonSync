## Notes:
### Commit 1
Please run my code using **app.js** instead of **bin/www**, for the moment. 
* updated the landing page from the default express one
  * added buttons 
  * updated fonts
* integrated socket.io (this is my first attempt so if there is anything wrong let me know
  * there is a window that pops up to test socket.io, it's only for testing purposes so disregard 
  
### Commit 2
Please run my code using **app.js** instead of **bin/www**, for the moment. 
* Routing between pages fixed, so the buttons work now 
* Started working on signup and login forms

Now that I have a understand express routing better hopefully linking between pages shouldnt't such a problem. The 
rest of the page should come smoothly. I can focus on other stuff now.
